==== What is 9x? ====
9x is a modern unix kernel that is based on the suckless philosiphy, that is, it aims to provide
great performace and security, while making the codebase simple and easy to read.

==== Building ====
Building 9x is really simple, all you need is git, xorriso, GCC/Clang GNU make, and QEMU (Optional, you can run it on real 
hardware if needed). Once all these tools are installed, you can simply run the following commands to build the kernel
 and bundle it into a image (only the ISO format is currently supported).

Build & Run in QEMU (Linux KVM required)
```
$ make run
```

Build kernel and generate ISO (build/test_kernel.iso)
```
make iso
```

NOTE: By default, `make` builds the kernel binary only.
